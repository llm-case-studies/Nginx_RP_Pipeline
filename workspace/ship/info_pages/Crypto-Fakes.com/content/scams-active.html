      <h3>Active "campaigns..." </h3>
      <p>that we are aware of. Technically, if no one reported a loss, they cannot be called scams, but there are so
        many "red flags"... <br>
        Unfortunately, someone already lost money - we just do not know about it yet, or is losing it at this moment, or
        is about to lose...
        <br>
        Once you learned about "campaigns" - make sure your friends are not falling to them and preyed upon.

        <h3>"On-boarding" log</h3>
        <p>
          <br>[2:25 PM, 3/1/2025] [HR Rep]: Hello! I got a notification from Diana who works at All- Star Staffing,
          recruiting company that you’re interested in the online data clerk position. Is that you?
          <br><br>[2:57 PM, 3/1/2025] [Your WhatsApp name]: Hi [HR Rep],
          I am interested in learning more about this position- the pay looks comparable to that of lawyers or doctors (
          midrange of course)
          with very basic requirements… What is expected from successful candidates?
          <br><br>[2:59 PM, 3/1/2025] [HR Rep]: I'm delighted to receive your response.
          I’d like to share an opportunity for an online part-time job with you
          <br><br>[3:03 PM, 3/1/2025] [HR Rep]: This job is easy and comfortable,
          and you can earn daily commissions and
          a salary of $6000 per month as extra income by just spending 1 hour of your time.
          Since it’s commission-based, you don’t need to sell anything.
          You have to optimize the applications to make them popular.
          It has no effect on your current job. If you are interested,
          I can explain the workflow and salary and commissions you can get daily.
          Would you prefer to ask when you're available, or should I go ahead and explain it now?
          <br><br>[6:19 PM, 3/1/2025] [HR Rep]: Good evening, Are you busy?
          <br><br>[6:52 PM, 3/1/2025] [HR Rep]: Why did you just see my message and not reply?
          Can I continue explaining about the work?
