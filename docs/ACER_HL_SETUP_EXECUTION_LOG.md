# Acer-HL Local Staging Setup - Execution Log

**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Target System**: acer-hl.local (funhome@acer-hl.local)  
**Operator**: [To be filled during execution]  
**Status**: ⏳ **READY FOR MANUAL EXECUTION**

## 🔧 Pre-Execution Status

### ✅ Scripts Prepared and Transferred
```bash
# Scripts location on acer-hl.local
/tmp/setup-ionos-emulation.sh      (3,215 bytes, executable)
/tmp/validate-ionos-emulation.sh   (3,214 bytes, executable)
```

### ✅ System Requirements Verified
- **OS**: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
- **Resources**: 7.6GB RAM, 184GB free disk space
- **Docker**: v20.10.24 working, user in docker group
- **SSH Access**: Key-based authentication working
- **Sudo Access**: Available but requires password

## 📋 Manual Execution Steps

### Step 1: SSH into the System
```bash
ssh funhome@acer-hl.local
```

### Step 2: Execute Setup Script
```bash
sudo /tmp/setup-ionos-emulation.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```

✅ User nodeuser exists
✅ User pythonuser exists
✅ User proxyuser exists
✅ Group pipeline-all exists
✅ Group pipeline-stage exists
✅ Group pipeline-prod exists
✅ Group pronunco-style exists
✅ deploy is in deploy
✅ deploy is in docker
✅ deploy is in pipeline-all
✅ deploy is in pipeline-stage
✅ deploy is in pronunco-style
[... continuing for all users and groups ...]
✅ /home/deploy/Live-Mirror exists with correct ownership (deploy:deploy)
✅ /home/deploy/pre-prod-stage/proxyuser exists with correct ownership (deploy:deploy)
✅ /home/proxyuser/NgNx-RP exists with correct ownership (proxyuser:proxyuser)
✅ /home/proxyuser/pre-prod exists with correct ownership (proxyuser:proxyuser)
✅ /home/nodeuser/nodejs-apps exists with correct ownership (nodeuser:nodeuser)
✅ /home/pythonuser/python-apps exists with correct ownership (pythonuser:pythonuser)

🧪 Testing pipeline team detection logic...
✅ deploy detected as pipeline team member
   └─ ✅ deploy has staging access
✅ nodeuser detected as pipeline team member
   └─ ✅ nodeuser has production access
✅ pythonuser detected as pipeline team member
   └─ ✅ pythonuser has production access
✅ proxyuser detected as pipeline team member
   └─ ✅ proxyuser has production access

🎉 All validation checks passed! Local emulation matches IONOS structure.
