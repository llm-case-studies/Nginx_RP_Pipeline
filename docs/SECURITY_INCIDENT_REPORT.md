# SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

## Incident: Production SSL Certificates Exposed in Git Repository

**Date Detected**: August 6, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Type**: Credential Exposure  
**Detection**: GitGuardian automated scanning

## What Happened

Production SSL certificates and private keys were accidentally committed to the public git repository, including:

- **RSA Private Keys** for production domains
- **SSL Certificates** for live websites:
  - pronunco.com
  - iLegalFlow.com  
  - iMediFlow.com
  - CutieTraders.com
  - Crypto-Fakes.com

## Files Exposed

Total: **42+ certificate files** across multiple workspace directories:
- `workspace/wip/certs/*/` 
- `workspace/prep/certs/*/`
- `workspace/ship/certs/*/`

File types exposed:
- `*.key` - Private keys ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
- `*.cer` - SSL certificates  
- `*.pem` - Certificate bundles

## Immediate Actions Taken

‚úÖ **Enhanced .gitignore** - Added comprehensive certificate exclusion patterns  
‚úÖ **Removed certificates from tracking** - Used `git rm` to untrack all cert files  
‚úÖ **Created incident report** - Documented exposure for remediation tracking  

## Required Next Steps

üö® **URGENT - Certificate Regeneration Required**:
1. **Revoke compromised certificates** immediately
2. **Generate new private keys** for all affected domains
3. **Request new SSL certificates** from certificate authority
4. **Update production servers** with new certificates
5. **Test certificate installation** on all affected domains

üîí **Repository Cleanup**:
1. **Purge certificates from git history** using BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch
2. **Force push cleaned history** (requires coordination with team)
3. **Verify complete removal** from all commits

## Prevention Measures

‚úÖ **Enhanced .gitignore** - Blocks all certificate file types  
üîÑ **Certificate management outside repo** - Store certs in secure locations  
üîÑ **Pre-commit hooks** - Scan for sensitive data before commits  
üîÑ **Secrets scanning** - Regular automated scanning for exposed credentials  

## Impact Assessment

**Production Impact**: All listed domains have compromised SSL certificates  
**Security Risk**: Private keys exposed publicly - certificates must be regenerated  
**Timeline**: Exposure duration from commit time until detection (several hours)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Certificate storage** should never be in version control
2. **Automated scanning** (GitGuardian) caught the issue quickly  
3. **Enhanced gitignore** patterns needed for comprehensive protection
4. **Pipeline design** should separate certificate management from code deployment

**Status**: Certificate removal complete, regeneration required  
**Next Action**: Coordinate certificate regeneration with infrastructure team
